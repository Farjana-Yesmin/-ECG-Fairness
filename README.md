Fairness-Aware ECG-Based Disease Prediction in Wearable Systems

This repository contains the official implementation of the paper "Fairness-Aware Representation Learning for ECG-Based Disease Prediction in Wearable Systems".

üìñ Paper Abstract

Machine learning models for electrocardiogram (ECG)-based disease prediction, increasingly integrated into wearable health devices, often exhibit demographic biases, exacerbating healthcare disparities. We propose a fairness-aware representation learning framework using adversarial debiasing tailored for biosignals, focusing on inferior myocardial infarction (IMI) classification. Our approach addresses biosignal-specific challenges, such as physiological variations across sex and age, differing from imaging or tabular data.

üöÄ Quick Start

Prerequisites

Python 3.8+
PyTorch 2.6.0+
WFDB package for ECG data handling
Google Colab (for free-tier GPU access)
Installation


# Install required packages
pip install wfdb torch==2.6.0 pandas scikit-learn matplotlib

# For GPU support (if available)
pip install torch==2.6.0+cu121 -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch_stable.html
Dataset Setup

The code uses the PTB-XL ECG dataset. The dataset will be automatically downloaded and preprocessed:


# Dataset will be downloaded from PhysioNet
# 20% subsample (4,367 records) used due to computational constraints
Running the Code

Execute the Jupyter notebook EAI_HealthWear_2025.ipynb sequentially:

Installation & Setup: Install dependencies and configure environment
